# On the Foundation of Neural Computation

## Abstract

This paper demonstrates that a large network of neurons mindlessly following Feynman’s “sum of all paths” rule can perform spectrum analysis, synthesize arbitrary signals, and approximate complex functions. It predicts that neural circuits are the basic storage and processing units, and the signals are transformed and stored in the frequency domain representation. 

It shows the detailed neural mechanism for read-write memory, pattern recognition, reinforcement learning, and the development of abstract concept and symbolic language. It deduces the unique behavior of the human mind, e.g. spontaneous pattern recognition without backpropagation, no separate training and inference phases, one-shot learning, the learned behavior is reversible and mirrors the probability distribution of inputs, etc. It makes quantified predictions on the behavior of collective minds, e.g. Zipfian distribution of word frequency and market capitalization of companies, fractal nature of the returns over a specific time window, etc. 

It proposes a proof-of-concept implementation of neural computers, e.g. physical devices performing parallel communication and Fourier transform in constant time. It provides a simple mechanism of how billions of mindless neurons fine-tune and develop a complex structure like the human brain. It discusses the driving force behind evolution and how it is related to the Principle of Least Action.

Finally, it explores the nature of consciousness, including the supposition of minds, free will, self-awareness, and the limitations of the human mind. It offers an intuitive interpretation of the basic concepts of quantum mechanics through the lens of human behavior.

## Personal Note

In the pursuit of a basic understanding of my own consciousness, I’ve destroyed everything that I once held dearly in my life: emotion, dream, love, free will, and self-awareness. It feels too cold to live a life full of illusions. When the temperature drops outside, I see water molecules cuddling together and forming these beautiful snowflakes. I see the colors of the rainbow reflected by their ephemeral existence. I think to myself what a beautiful sight! It’s a miracle for a snowflake to even contemplate the meaning of life.

After a day of mundane life, it’s become a pastime for me to watch Feynman’s lectures online. His path integral formulation of quantum mechanics gives me an intuitive understanding of the inner workings of the universe. Feynman once remarked after reflecting on the intellectual journey of developing his theory:

>*So what happened to the old theory that I fell in love with as a youth? Well, I would say it’s become an old lady that has very little attractive left in her and the young today will not have their hearts pound anymore when they look at her. But, we can say the best we can for any old woman, that she has been a very good mother and she has given birth to some very good children.*

Well, at least one young today looks at the old lady. His heart starts to pound and his mind cannot help but ponder the secret of life and nature. Hope the sparklings from one tiny snowflake add a bit of color to your understanding of life and nature, too.
